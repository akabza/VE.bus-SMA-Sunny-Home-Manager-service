# Victron Energy D-Bus for SMA Sunny Home Manager

This project was inspired by the idea to use an existing SMA Sunny Home Manager 2.0 as energy meter for a Victron Energy GX device, e.g. Venus OS running on a Raspberry Pi.

This Python-Code is based on https://github.com/victronenergy/velib_python/blob/master/dbusdummyservice.py
